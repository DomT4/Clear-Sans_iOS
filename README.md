Clear-Sans_iOS
==============

My iOS port of Intel's open font [Clear Sans](https://01.org/clear-sans). 30+ hours of work and counting into this. I'll keep updating as regularly as required. 2100+ downloads to date.

iOS7 only at the moment. Due to changes Apple made between iOS6 & iOS7 the way fonts are created is significantly different between the two iOS versions and consequently for now, this is iOS7 only.

The easiest way to apply this is by:

* Jailbreak your iDevice, Download 'Bytafont 2'.
* Download/Clone this repo, FTP into your iDevice, go to var > mobile > Library > MyFonts2 and drop the ClearSans.font folder into there.
* Open up 'Bytafont 2', under 'Basic' choose 'Clear Sans' and apply.

Please note there are two different licenses applied to this port. The first is the officially necessary license applied by Intel and mandated to accompany any usage of Clear Sans. The second license is to cover my own work, and is a CC0 1.0 Universal license.

In short, you can use my work as you like, without any restriction, need for compensation, attribution & for commercial or non-commercial usage. The Apache license mandated by Intel is similar, but retains the mandate that their license must be included in all derivative products.
